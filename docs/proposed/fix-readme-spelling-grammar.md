## Fix Spelling and Grammar Errors in README

### Background

The PRRadar-TestRepo has a proposed task (`docs/proposed/fix-readme-spelling-grammar.md`) to fix spelling and grammar errors in the README.md file. The README was intentionally committed with typos (per commit message: "Add README with intentional typos for DevPilot testing"). A quick review confirms the README still contains numerous spelling errors (e.g., "Repostory", "funtionality", "Overveiw", "contians", "implmentation", "demonstraets", "operatoins", "primarly", "sandox", "developement", "Fetures", "numbrs", "Multipication", "divison", "handeling", "divde", "scenarioes", "readble", "Geting", "calculater", "intalled", "systm", "Contriubting", "submitt", "requsts", "accompained", "approriate", "Liscense", "availible", "liscense"). This task is the simplest remaining proposed item — the greeting function task is already complete (in `docs/completed/`), and the "test task" item is vague and undefined.

## - [ ] Phase 1: Interpret the Request

When executed, this phase will explore the codebase and recent commits (authored by Bill Gestrich) to understand what the voice transcription is asking for. It will find the relevant code, files, and areas. This phase is purely about understanding — no implementation planning yet. The voice text may have transcription errors; use recent commits and codebase context to infer intent. Document findings underneath this phase heading.

## - [ ] Phase 2: Gather Architectural Guidance

When executed, this phase will look at the repository's skills () and architecture docs (docs/architecture.md) to identify which documentation and architectural guidelines are relevant to this request. It will read and summarize the key constraints. Document findings underneath this phase heading.

## - [ ] Phase 3: Plan the Implementation

When executed, this phase will use insights from Phases 1 and 2 to create concrete implementation steps. It will append new phases (Phase 4 through N) to this document, each with: what to implement, which files to modify, which architectural documents to reference, and acceptance criteria. It will also append a Testing/Verification phase and a Create Pull Request phase at the end. This phase is responsible for generating the remaining phases dynamically.
