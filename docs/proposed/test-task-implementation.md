## Test Task Implementation Plan

### Background
This plan outlines the phased approach for completing the "Test task" request. The implementation will follow a structured process: first interpreting what needs to be done by examining the codebase and recent commits, then gathering relevant architectural guidance from the repository's documentation, and finally creating a detailed implementation plan with concrete steps.

## - [ ] Phase 1: Interpret the Request
When executed, this phase will explore the codebase and recent commits (authored by Bill Gestrich) to understand what the voice transcription is asking for. It will find the relevant code, files, and areas. This phase is purely about understanding — no implementation planning yet. The voice text may have transcription errors; use recent commits and codebase context to infer intent. Document findings underneath this phase heading.

## - [ ] Phase 2: Gather Architectural Guidance
When executed, this phase will look at the repository's skills () and architecture docs (docs/architecture.md) to identify which documentation and architectural guidelines are relevant to this request. It will read and summarize the key constraints. Document findings underneath this phase heading.

## - [ ] Phase 3: Plan the Implementation
When executed, this phase will use insights from Phases 1 and 2 to create concrete implementation steps. It will append new phases (Phase 4 through N) to this document, each with: what to implement, which files to modify, which architectural documents to reference, and acceptance criteria. It will also append a Testing/Verification phase and a Create Pull Request phase at the end. This phase is responsible for generating the remaining phases dynamically.
