# PRRadar Test Repository Architecture

## Overview

This is a simple test repository for validating the DevPilot CLI workflow.

## Code Structure

- `Calculator.swift` - Simple calculator implementation
- `rules/` - Repository rules and guidelines

## Development Guidelines

1. All new Swift files should include a header comment with the file purpose
2. Use Swift naming conventions (PascalCase for types, camelCase for functions/variables)
3. Keep functions simple and focused on a single responsibility
4. Add inline comments for non-obvious logic

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
swift test
```

## Coding Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Always include error handling where appropriate
